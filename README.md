# portfolio

This is my the Content Management System (CMS) of my [Portfolio blog](https://lopezaxel.netlify.app/blog), 
this is where I sign in and write posts for my blog, I can publish and unpublish 
posts, update and delete posts and comments, and write comments, and posts with 
[TinyMCE editor](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/), a complete text editor.

Done with React as a front end, of my portfolio blog RESTful API: [portfolio-blog-api](https://github.com/lopezac/portfolio-blog-api).

Picked the color scheme with [Paletton](https://paletton.com/)

I tried prismJS and react-syntax-highlighter but none seemed to worked so code snippets ended being only white.
